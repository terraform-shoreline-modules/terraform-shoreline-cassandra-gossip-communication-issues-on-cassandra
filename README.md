### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Gossip Communication Issues on Cassandra
---

Gossip Communication Issues refer to problems encountered in the Gossip protocol, which is responsible for node communication and cluster coordination in distributed systems such as Cassandra. When the Gossip protocol experiences issues, it can lead to inconsistencies and disruptions in the communication between nodes, leading to system-wide problems. These issues can arise due to various reasons such as network issues, hardware failures, or bugs in the software. It is crucial to detect and resolve such issues quickly to ensure the smooth functioning of the system.

### Parameters
```shell
export NODE_IP="PLACEHOLDER"

export CASSANDRA_PORT="PLACEHOLDER"

export NODE3="PLACEHOLDER"

export NODE1="PLACEHOLDER"

export NODE2="PLACEHOLDER"

export ENDPOINTS="PLACEHOLDER"

export INTERVAL="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Cassandra is running
```shell
systemctl status cassandra.service
```

### Check if the Gossip protocol is enabled
```shell
nodetool info | grep -i gossip
```

### Check the status of the Gossip protocol
```shell
nodetool gossipinfo
```

### Check the communication between nodes
```shell
nodetool ring
```

### Check for any errors in the system log related to the Gossip protocol
```shell
journalctl -u cassandra.service | grep -i gossip
```

### Check for any network issues that may be causing communication problems
```shell
ping ${NODE_IP}
```

### Check for any firewall rules blocking communication between nodes
```shell
iptables -L -n
```

### Check for any other processes or applications that may be interfering with Cassandra
```shell
lsof -i :${CASSANDRA_PORT}
```

### Check for any performance issues that may be affecting Cassandra
```shell
nodetool tpstats
```

## Repair

### Identify and isolate the affected nodes, and then restart them to see if this resolves the issue.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Identify the affected nodes

NODES="${NODE1} ${NODE2} ${NODE3}"



# Isolate the affected nodes

for NODE in $NODES

do

    echo "Isolating node: $NODE"

    ssh $NODE "sudo /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 9042 -j DROP"

done



# Restart the affected nodes

for NODE in $NODES

do

    echo "Restarting node: $NODE"

    ssh $NODE "sudo /sbin/service cassandra restart"

done


```

### Consider adjusting the gossip settings, such as adjusting the gossip interval or increasing the number of endpoints the nodes can communicate with.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set the gossip interval to ${INTERVAL}

gossip_interval=${INTERVAL}

cassandra_yaml_file=${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA_YAML}



# Adjust the gossip interval

sed -i "s/^#*\(gossip\_interval\:*\).*/\1 ${gossip_interval}/" ${cassandra_yaml_file}



# Set the number of endpoints to ${ENDPOINTS}

num_endpoints=${ENDPOINTS}



# Adjust the number of endpoints

sed -i "s/^#*\(num\_endpoints\:*\).*/\1 ${num_endpoints}/" ${cassandra_yaml_file}



# Restart Cassandra to apply the changes

systemctl restart cassandra.service


```
